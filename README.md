# jQuery-tableFormSynch-plugin-demo
This repo contains a jQuery plugin file that leverages the jQuery metadata plugin to synchronize/exchange data between a master
list and a detail form.  It was created in January 2009 as an alternative to the standard master/detail pattern where viewing
and editing record details required navigating to a separate page.

This demo was originally hosted on a personal web server.  It was ported her to GitHub to preserve it as inspiration for
other developers, although most modern JavaScript frameworks provide a means for this sort of data exchange.

The working demo is available here: https://bcswartz.github.io/jQuery-tableFormSynch-plugin-demo/

The documentation for using the plugin can be found inside the documented version of the plugin file (assets/javascript/jquery.tableFormSynch.documented.js)
